# blocklists
Generic Blocklists for common platforms you may want to block for various reasons.

I don't always keep these up to date!

I created this list in order to A) learn pi-hole and B) filter out/in specific apps to reduce the amount of spying certain devices did.

Each txt file contains the domains (or some of) the domains of the company it is named after. furry.txt contains Furry specific sites (assorted). I don't know why you'd want to use that list outside of being funny to someone or blocking them for children, but you can always use a better NSFW blocklist. (Or both)
